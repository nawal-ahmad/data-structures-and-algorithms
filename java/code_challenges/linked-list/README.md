# Singly Linked List
Linked List is a linear data structure, LinkedList can be represented as a class and a Node as a separate class. The LinkedList class contains a reference of Node class type.
## Challenge 5
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
- Create a Linked List class include a head property.
The class contain the following methods:
    - **insert** to adds a new node with value to the head of the list.
    - **includes** to indicates whether a specific value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
    - **to string**: return a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as: `"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"`

## Approach & Efficiency
- in the insert method i added nodes to the first so I didnt use any loops.
```
Big O time = O(1)
Big O space = O(1)
```
- in the includes method i used while loop.
```
Big O time = O(n)
Big O space = O(1)
```
- in the toString method i used the while loop to assign the values of nodes to a String variable.
```
Big O time = O(n)
Big O space = O(1)
```
## API
insert : adding nodes to the linked list.
includes : checking for a specific value if it exist in the linked list.
toString : adding the values in a String variable to be printed.


# Linked List Insertion 6

# Challenge Summary
Add three methods:
- **append** : add a node to the end of the linked list.
![append](/java/code_challenges/linked-list/assets/append.jpg)

- **insertBefore** : insert a node before another node.
![insert-before](/java/code_challenges/linked-list/assets/insert-before.jpg)

- **insertAfter** :  insert a node after another node.
![insert-after](/java/code_challenges/linked-list/assets/insert-after.jpg)
## Approach & Efficiency
> append :
- Time : big O(1)
-  space: big O(1).

> insertBefore:
- Time : big O(n).
- space: big O(1).

> insertAfter:
- Time : big O(n).
- space: big O(1).


# Linked List kth 7

# Challenge Summary
create a method **kthFromEnd** that accept a k value, and return the value of the nodes with index k counting from the end
## Whiteboard
![kth](/java/code_challenges/linked-list/assets/kth.jpg)
## Approach & Efficiency
- Time : big O(n)
-  space: big O(1).

# Zip Linked List  8
# Challenge Summary
create a method **zipLists** zip two linked lists together in one, the node alternate between them.
## Whiteboard
![zip-list](/java/code_challenges/linked-list/assets/zip-list.jpg)
## Approach & Efficiency
- Time : big O(n)
-  space: big O(n).
