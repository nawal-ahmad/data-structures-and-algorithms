# Stacks and Queues

A stack (data structure) is a collection of items in which only the most recently added item may be removed. The latest added item is at the top. **FILO**

A queue (data structure) is a collection of items in which only the earliest added item may be accessed.

## Challenge

In this challenge, creating stack and queue basic operations(methods).

## Approach & Efficiency

All of the implemented methods are of O(1) time and space complexities.

## API

- Stacks:
    - Push: adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack.
    - Pop: Removes the node from the top of the stack.
    - Peek: returns the value of the node located at the top of the stack.
    - isEmpty:  Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.

- Queues:
    - Enqueue: adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue.
    - Dequeue : Removes the node from the front of the queue.
    - Peek : return the value of the node located at the front of the queue.
    - isEmpty : Boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty.
